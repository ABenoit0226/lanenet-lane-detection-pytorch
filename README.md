# Lanenet-Lane-Detection (pytorch version)
  
Use pytorch to implement a Deep Neural Network for real time lane detection mainly based on the IEEE IV conference paper "Towards End-to-End Lane Detection: an Instance Segmentation Approach".You can refer to their paper for details https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05591. This model consists of ENet encoder, ENet decoder for binary semantic segmentation and ENet decoder for instance semantic segmentation using discriminative loss function.  

The main network architecture is:
